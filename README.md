# Fake News Detection

This is a simple web application designed to help users determine whether a news headline is likely real or fake. The application uses a simulated logic to detect fake news, providing real-time feedback with a loading spinner, and visually distinguishing the results (real or fake) with distinct colors.

## Features
**User Input**: Users can enter a news headline to check.
**Fake News Detection**: Simulated logic randomly determines whether the news is real or fake.
**Loading Spinner**: A loading spinner appears while the application simulates checking the news.
**Stylish UI**: Clean and responsive design with animations and hover effects.
**Result Feedback**: Displays the result with a "real" or "fake" label and distinct colors.

## Technologies Used
**HTML**: For creating the structure of the web page.
 **CSS**: For styling and animations.
 **JavaScript**: For handling logic and interactions, including simulating fake news detection and displaying results.

## How to Run
1. **Clone the Repository**:

2. **Open the `index.html` file in your browser** to start using the application.

3. **Input a news headline** and click on the "Check Now" button. The application will simulate checking whether the headline is real or fake.
